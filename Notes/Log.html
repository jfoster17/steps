<h4>β06 (20/10 2020):</h4>

<li>Free Spell Circles counter OK</li>
<li>Width on Rank field in Play. OK!</li>

<h4>β04 (12/9 2020):</h4>
<li>Bit of improvement in the error handling when loading a character file</li>
<li>Input Validation poked a little at. Perhaps this is enough =P</li>
<li>When switching away from a spellcaster discipline, don't leave 'dead' spells lying around. Same with Knacks no longer qualified for. OK</li>
<li>For some reason, Matrices don't show? Do now; it was a couple self-closed tags (o:</li>
<li>Astral-sensitive Eye and other blood charms seem to not show their modifiers right. Now I wonder if they calculate =P (Jonathans's player) OK</li>
<li>Categories for spells, equipment optional Talents and Knacks</li>
<li>Suggest feature for Artisan and Knowledge skills; I've rounded out the lists a lot. </li>

<h4>β03 (4/9 2020):</h4>
<li>Threead armors: Forging didn't apply</li>
<li>Something dies when changing ranks on a threaded shield? No? It was the specific shield that had a mistake in the data file</li>

<li>Sorting data by name in the Library after book selection. </li>
<li>Mystic Paths and Elven Nations data entry started.</li>
<li>Something was very wrong in the adding Disciplines logic. Analyzed, sorted out and told very sternly to behave. </li>

<li>Air Sailor Circle 15 Talent fixed (Sebastian)</li>
<li>Dwarven carry capacity doesn't work (reported by someone =P) OK</li>
<li>Matrices gained from Thread Items don't show their rank correctly in the Talents list. They DO show it correctly on the Matrix card, and the card  seems to work. Was a curly brackets issue - Fixed. Oddly enough, Other Talents gained through Items do Not seem to register the rank right? No; other Talents gained through Items have a modifier to the talent Step, not a Rank per se. I now wonder if I should include a bonus column too, and add even More numbers to the sheet =P</li>

<li>Blood Damage somehow misses blood charms? Nope; just only counted the very last one. OK, and Blood Damage / Wounds breakdown added.</li>
<li>Group Patterns don't adjust the Defenses or Health values (Brett Bowen) - Probably related to the one Joel reported - it was. OK</li>
<li>Group patterns don't seem to save Ranks right (Joel Fowler) OK</li>
<li>Starting characters can have Circle 2 spells (should be set free or follow the correct Talent rank) (Brett Bowen) - Limit on Circle for spell selection removed</li>
